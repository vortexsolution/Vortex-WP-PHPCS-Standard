# Vortex PHPCS Standard

## Installation

Just clone this repo in your PHPCS install. Ideally, it should be at the same level as the WordPress ones, because it has a dependency on them.

On my laptop, it's in there: `/c/tools/wordpress-phpcs/`

Then, make sure your PHPCS standard is the right one in your editor. The name will come from the name of the directory, so if you cloned the repo and didn't change anything, it should be "Vortex-PHPCS-Standard". Otherwise, a `phpcs -i` will list all standards available.
